Beacon API
======================================

.. epigraph::

    The Beacon project was launched in 2014 to show the willingness of researchers to enable the secure sharing of
    genomic data from participants of genomic studies.
    Beacons are web-servers that answer questions such as Does your dataset include a genome that has a specific nucleotide (e.g. G)
    at a specific genomic coordinate (e.g. Chr.1 position 111,111)? to which the Beacon must respond with yes or no,
    without referring to a specific individual.
